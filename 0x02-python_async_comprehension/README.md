Asynchronous Generators, Async Comprehensions, and Generator Type Annotations

This document provides a brief overview of asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and generator type annotations in Python.

Asynchronous Generators

    Concept: Functions that produce values asynchronously using async def and yield. They can be iterated over with async for loops.
    Benefits:
        Efficient asynchronous operation handling.
        Pausable and resumable iteration for long-running tasks.
        Seamless integration with async for loops.
